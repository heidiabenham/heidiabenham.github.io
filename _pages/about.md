Greetings! My name is Heidi Benham and I am a sixth year mathematics PhD student at UConn under the direction of [Dr. Damir Dzhafarov](https://www.damirdzhafarov.com/). 

When I'm not working on math or teaching, there are quite a few activities I enjoy, many of which I do with my [husband](https://dionmann.github.io/). Creativity and intellectual development appear to be the common motifs with regard to my favorite activities-- I love broadening my mind and finding unique ways of expressing my thoughts. Writing fiction, sewing, reading, and learning languages are the primary hobbies that come to mind. When I'm too exhausted for any of these, I enjoy playing board games and computer games and listening to indie music.

Research Interests
=====

My reasearch interests can be broadly classified as mathematical logic. More specifically, my interests are in reverse mathematics and computability theory.
